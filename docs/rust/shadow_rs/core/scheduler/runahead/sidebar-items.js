window.SIDEBAR_ITEMS = {"struct":[["Runahead","Decides on the runahead for the next simulation round (the duration of the round). Having a larger runahead improves performance since more hosts and more events can be run in parallel during a simulation round, but if the runahead is too large then packets will be delayed until the next simulation round which is beyond their intended latency. This uses a fixed runahead of the provided minimum possible latency when dynamic runahead is disabled, and otherwise uses a dynamic runahead of the minimum used latency. Both runahead calculations have a static lower bound."]]};
